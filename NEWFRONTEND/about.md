This is a UI implementation for the Fox Registry application. Which in turn is an attempt to 
express certain ideas about building cloud-suitable applications in code so they can be 
deployed, broken and generally messed with.

The original wiki page with the architecture we seek to implement is available [here](https://www.ria.ee/riigiarhitektuur/wiki/doku.php?id=an:rebasteregister)

The source code of this application is available here
